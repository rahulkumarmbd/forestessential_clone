                review: "Kumkumadi Night Cream is best for Oily, Acne-Prone skin as I have it. I’ve got severe acne on my facial organ. Initially, I’ve used it for 2 nights and saw the results instantly. It reduced my post-acne scars and blemishes in 2nd use. It smells like Kesar (Saffron), a very sweet, and lovely pale pink color. It’s been 5 weeks of using it, and it’s working great. I can see the visible differences in my skin. I love this product.",

It helps with pigmentation, smoothens the skin, helps in reducing scars and acne. Perfect night cream. Loved it!",
